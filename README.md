create folder named "img" to save images, and also install cloudflare
ALRIGHT!!


INSTALL THESE USING PYTHON-PIP IF THERE ARE NOT AVAILABLE os, sys, subprocess, platform, threading, time, base64, re, json, datetime.
if flask failed to install, do it manually:

-> sudo pip install flask flask-cors --break-system-packages

if it doesn't work use:

-> sudo pip3 install flask flask-cors --break-system-packages

Then run it: -> sudo server.py
